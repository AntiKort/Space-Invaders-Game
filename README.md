# Space-Invaders-Game
Space Invaders Game Documentation 

Project Goals: 

The goal of this project was to implement a basic Space Invaders game using the Pygame library. The objectives included creating a playable game with a player-controlled character, enemies, collision detection, and a scoring system. 

Player Instructions: 

Move Left: Use the left arrow key. 

Move Right: Use the right arrow key. 

Game Start: The game starts after a countdown. Get ready to dodge enemies and increase your score. 

Technologies and Techniques Used: 

Programming Language: Python 

Game Development Library: Pygame 

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Used for organizing code into player and enemy classes. 

Collision Detection: Implemented using Pygame's sprite collision functions. 

Game Loop: Utilized a game loop for continuous updates and rendering. 

Citations for External Resources: 

No external resources were used in the development of this project. All code and assets were created from scratch. 

Process Description: 

What I Learned: 

Gain a practical understanding of game development concepts. 

Implement basic game mechanics such as player movement, enemy generation, and collision detection. 

Work with Pygame library for creating 2D games. 

Challenges and Solutions: 

Stuck Points: Overcoming challenges with sprite movement and positioning. 

Solutions: Utilized Pygame documentation and community forums for problem-solving. 

Areas for Improvement: 

Implement more features such as shooting mechanics and power-ups. 

Enhance graphics and visual effects for a more engaging experience. 

Lessons for Next Time: 

Plan and design more features before starting implementation. 

Test and iterate regularly for a smoother development process. 

Game Design Document: 

Adherence: The project closely followed the initial design document. 

Adjustments: Some adjustments were made based on iterative development and testing. 

Staying on Track: 

Used version control (Git) for tracking changes and collaboration. 

Broke down development into manageable milestones for focused progress.
